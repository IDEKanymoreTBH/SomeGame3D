A Random Game That I May Or May Not Finish

So, This Game I Made. Not That Impressive. I May Finish It If I Want To. If You Want To Try It, Just Put The Whole Folder In Your IDE And Do `./gradlew build` And `./gradlew run`. This Game May Be Updated, But IDK For Now I Am Burnt Out. Make Some Commit And Pull Requests If You Want.
